# NCSDecomp Rules and Conventions for AI LLM agents

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Git Commit Requirement ⚠️

**MANDATORY FOR ALL AI AGENTS**: After making ANY changes to files in this repository, you MUST:

1. **Stage all modified files**: `git add <file1> <file2> ...` (or `git add .` for all changes)
2. **Commit with a descriptive message**: `git commit -m "type: descriptive message"`
3. **Verify the commit succeeded**: Check that `git commit` returns successfully with no errors

**This is NOT optional.** Do NOT summarize changes without committing them. Do NOT skip this step. Every code change, file modification, or configuration update MUST be committed before you consider the task complete.

**Commit message format**: Use conventional commits format:

- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `feat:` for new features
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- `test:` for test changes

Example: `git commit -m "fix: correct finalize job condition in workflow"`

## Documentation

When creating ANY new `.md` files, always follow these guidelines:

- Always place within `docs`
- Never report on progression (changes and what still remains to be done).
- Exclusively provide public-facing documentation, something an end user will need to read if they want to either develop for NCSDecomp or work with it.

Please do not create .md documentation unless it delivers public-facing information or authoritative gameplay/platform references that an end user or developer genuinely needs for NCSDecomp or the games themselves.

## Helper Scripts

- Always place within `scripts`
- Should be idempotent and flexible enough to be used for a plethora of scenarios, not just whatever the task you're working on involves.
- Do not delete helper .py/.ps1/.sh scripts when you are finished with them; keep them in scripts folder
